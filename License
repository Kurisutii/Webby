[#] Webby - Version 0.1 Alpha - Pre-Release.
[#] Coded by Kurisuti - Started June 2020.

[#] Webby is a simple request handler written
in Python to help with Web Application testing.

[#] If you want to edit this script, you must
send me the changes first, so that I can review
them and possibly change them or deny them.

[#] You may not charge money for this in any
shape, sort, form or way, without any exception.

[#] The 'Scans' folder is useless, feel free to
remove it, as it is only a folder to send outputs
to, for more convenience.
